# MyApplication2

I followed a tutorial by Derek Banas, but it turned out to be outdated so all the code didn't work. 
I was quite demotivated since I couldn'r really figure out how to do the HTTPrequests and get the json from the internet
I copied code from the internet now to get the HTTP request, I think it works but the deadline is now so...
